RETS-LARAVEL = Using the Laravel framework and the PHRETS library to retrieve data from CRMLS RETS server.
RETS = Real Estate Transaction Standard
CRMLS = California Regional Multiple Listing Service

Python would be a good choice to process data, but CRMLS seems to be only willing to give out the RETS API credential. Bummer!

So until then, the Python RESO Web API library is no bueno!
